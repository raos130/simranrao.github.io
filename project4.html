            <div class="header">
              <div class="textdirector"> <p>A series of publications highlighting some
                 of my favorite directors and trying to encapsulate their style
                  and common themes that recur in their films in the design of each publication.

              <div class="alfredtext"><p class="directortext">ALFRED HITCHCOCK </p>
                <p class="directortext1">This publication was inspired by the posters of some of
                   Hitchcock's most iconic films, <i> Vertigo</i> and <i>Just Dial M for Murder,</i>
                    as well as his themes of danger and suspense, which I represented with bold colors and text. The narrow
                  columns of text are reminescent of his simple yet dynamic style of story-telling, making something
                interesting from very few elements, as seen in <i> Rear Window.</i></p>

          <div class="denistext"> <p class="directortext">DENIS VILLENEUVE </p>
            <p class="directortext1">Villeneuve is known for his dark, psychological thrillers complete with unexpected
              plot twist. To encapsulate the tone, I used a dark color palette with a white to create a vivid contrast.
              The flipped text plays with his themes of chaos and twist endings, as seen in <i>Enemy</i> and <i>Prisoners</i>
               as well as the introspective nature of the film. His films are known for their strong visual aesthetics,
               and I tried to create my own stark color palette for this publication. </p>

          <div class="nolantext"><p class="directortext"> CHRISTOPHER NOLAN</p>
            <p class="directortext1">This publication was inspired by Nolan's signature style of film-making.
            To represent his themes of identity and twins, as seen in <i>Inception</i> and <i> The Prestige</i>,
             I used multiple fonts and contrasted each alternate page to create a dynamic sense of reptition.
            Another staple element in his films, is his non-linear way of story-telling. The offset emphasised text is a break from this publications set guide of narrating content.  </p>
